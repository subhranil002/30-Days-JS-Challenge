// Solve the "N-Queens" problem on LeetCode.

// Write a function that places n queens on an nxn chessboard such that no two queens attack each other, and returns all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.
// Log the distinct solutions for a few test cases

// TODO To Be Continued later ... :)
