## Daily Tasks

### Day 1: Variables and Data Types

-   **Task 1**: Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.
-   **Task 2**: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.
-   **Task 3**: Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.
-   **Task 4**: Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.
-   **Task 5**: Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.
-   **Task 6**: Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.
